# How to Use 4 GB or 8 GB RAM on Windows 7 32-bit with 32bit-Rampatch
 
Windows 7 32-bit is a popular operating system that can run on most computers. However, it has a limitation that prevents it from using more than 3.25 GB of RAM, even if you have 4 GB or 8 GB installed. This can affect the performance and stability of your system, especially if you run memory-intensive applications.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to bypass this limitation and enable Windows 7 32-bit to use the full amount of RAM you have. This involves using a tool called 32bit-Rampatch, which modifies the kernel of Windows 7 to allow it to access more memory. In this article, we will show you how to use 32bit-Rampatch to increase your RAM on Windows 7 32-bit.

## What is 32bit-Rampatch?
 
32bit-Rampatch is a tool that was created by a user named wj32 on the My Digital Life forums[^1^]. It is based on a patch by Gavotte that was originally designed for Windows XP. The tool works by injecting a driver into the kernel of Windows 7 that hooks the memory management functions and changes the way they allocate and map memory. This allows Windows 7 to use up to 64 GB of RAM on a 32-bit system.
 
## How to Use 32bit-Rampatch?
 
Before you use 32bit-Rampatch, you need to make sure that your system meets the following requirements:
 
- You have a compatible processor that supports Physical Address Extension (PAE). Most modern processors do, but you can check by using a tool like CPU-Z.
- You have at least 4 GB or 8 GB of RAM installed on your system.
- You have Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) installed. You can check by going to Control Panel > System and Security > System.
- You have disabled Driver Signature Enforcement. You can do this by pressing F8 during boot and selecting Disable Driver Signature Enforcement from the Advanced Boot Options menu.

Once you have met these requirements, you can follow these steps to use 32bit-Rampatch:

1. Download the latest version of 32bit-Rampatch from [here](https://www.unitedartistsofdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2011_32bitrampatchv10windows732bitwithfull4gbor8gbramsupport.pdf). The file name should be something like (2011) 32bit-rampatch-v1.0-windows-7-32-bit-with-full-4-gb-or-8-gb-ram-support.zip.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder of your choice.
3. Run the file named patch.exe as administrator. You can do this by right-clicking on it and selecting Run as administrator.
4. A command prompt window will open and ask you to press any key to continue. Do so and wait for the patching process to finish.
5. Reboot your system for the changes to take effect.

## How to Check if 32bit-Rampatch Worked?
 
After rebooting your system, you can check if 32bit-Rampatch worked by doing the following:

- Go to Control Panel > System and Security > System and look at the Installed Memory (RAM) section. It should show the full amount of RAM you have, such as 4.00 GB or 8.00 GB.
- Open Task Manager by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc and go to the Performance tab. Look at the Physical Memory section and see if it matches the amount of RAM you have.
- Run a memory-intensive application or game and see if it performs better or uses more memory than before.

## How to Uninstall 32bit-Rampatch?
 
If you want to uninstall 32bit-Rampatch for any reason, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Run the file named unpatch.exe as administrator. You can do this by
